"""
Contains utilities for interacting with experiments. If you want to change the currently running
experiment, do the following:

1. Change the get_new_experiment() function to return the new experiment you want to run.
2. Change the get_new_experiment() in the mitoinstaller to use the new experiment id as well.
3. Add this to the experiment tracker in notion so we remember what the experiments are.
4. Actually use the new experiment (and remove old experiment code).

That's it! We can continue to optimize this over time, but that is fine for now.
