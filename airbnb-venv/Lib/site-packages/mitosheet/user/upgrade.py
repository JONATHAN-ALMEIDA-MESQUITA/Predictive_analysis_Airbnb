Contains helpful functions for upgrading the user.json file
from previous versions to the current version.

An explination of how we used to do things:
1. We had a `user.json` file, which either didn't have a version number or was version 1
2. We added fields to the `user.json` file when the user loads it, 
   setting them equal to the new default values
3. We never made any backwards incompatible changes

However, we now want to make some backwards incompatible changes. We do that by having mulitple
schemas for the user.json file, and having an upgrade process that upgrades from one schema to 
the other.

1. For new users who show up, they will just get a default `user.json` file. 
   It will have the most up to date version number in it, obviously.

2. When old users show up, we compare the version of the user.json that they 
   have to the current version of the user.json.
   - If they have a user.json with _no version_ number or _version 1_, then we make sure they
     have the "final schema" for version 1. We only need to do this because of how we used to 
     change version 1 without making new versions.
   - Then, if they have an old version of the user.json, then we actually do an upgrade from one 
     version to the next. Simply using an upgrade script that converts.

_Any change the user.json format must be met with a version bump._
