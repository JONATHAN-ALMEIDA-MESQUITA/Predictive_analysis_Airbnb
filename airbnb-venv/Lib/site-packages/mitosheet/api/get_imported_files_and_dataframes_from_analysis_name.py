    Returns a list all the imported files and dataframes, and their import params. Does so by turning
    the import into a list of imports that only import a single dataframe, as this is convenient
    for what we work with on the frontend.

    A mirror of get_imported_files_and_dataframes_from_current_steps, but works from saved analysis data, and is used
    when a replayed analysis is failed - as there are no steps in the steps_manager currently.

    In the case where we're getting import data from a saved analysis, we do not have step ids to use.
    But we don't need step ids, as when we replay an analysis we can just replace import events based
    on the index of the import. As such, don't worry about step_ids in the UpdateImportPreReplay
    case, as this uses the replay_analysis function and matched based on indexes.
