class Step:
    """
    A step is a container around a specific data transformation.

    A step has parameters - e.g. which sheet it touches, which column
    it edits.

    It then is linked to a StepPerformer class via the step_type. 
    The Step uses a mapping from its step_type to the StepPerformer 
    to figure out the correct step generator to use at any given time. 

    This StepPerformer is responsible for "executing" this step, which 
    functionally means taking the prev_state that this step starts at,
    and using the step's parameters to create a new post_state that 
    is up to date.

    This also stores execution_data from that execution - which makes
    for easy transpiling of the step! For example, a simple import
    stores what the delimeters used in the files it read in are, so
    that it can transpile this easily.
